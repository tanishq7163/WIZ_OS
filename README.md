# 🧠 Building an Operating System from Scratch

A complete hands-on journey to understanding how computers work at their core.  
This project builds a **custom 32-bit Operating System** from the ground up — starting with a simple bootloader and evolving into a working kernel written in **Assembly** and **C**.

---

## 🚀 Overview  
This repository serves as both a **learning resource** and a **working OS project**.  
It demonstrates every layer of an operating system — from CPU initialization to memory management, multitasking, and drivers.  

If you’ve ever wanted to know **what happens after you press the power button**, this project will take you through that journey line by line.

---

## 🧩 Key Features  
- Custom **FAT12 bootloader** written in NASM  
- Switch from **Real Mode** → **Protected Mode**  
- **GDT**, **IDT**, and **interrupt handling**  
- Simple **C-based kernel**  
- Low-level **screen and keyboard I/O**  
- **Memory management** (paging, heap)  
- **Multitasking & scheduling**  
- **Custom drivers** for keyboard, VGA, and disk  
- Boots and runs on **QEMU** or real hardware

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
| Category | Tools / Languages |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Languages** | NASM Assembly, C |
| **Compiler** | i686-elf GCC |
| **Emulator** | QEMU |
| **Build System** | Makefile |
| **Architecture** | 32-bit x86 Protected Mode |

## 📂 Project Structure  
```

/bootloader   → Boot sector & FAT12 loader
/kernel       → Core OS kernel written in C
/lib          → Custom standard library (printf, string, etc.)
/drivers      → Hardware drivers (keyboard, VGA, disk)
/docs         → OS development notes and explanations

## ⚙️ Setup & Run  

### 1️⃣ Install Required Tools  
Make sure you have the following installed:  
- **QEMU** emulator  
- **i686-elf GCC cross-compiler**  
- **Make** build system  

> For Windows users, setup via **MSYS2** or **WSL** is recommended.

---

### 2️⃣ Build & Run  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/build-your-own-os.git
cd build-your-own-os
make run
````

This will compile the bootloader, kernel, and run the OS inside QEMU.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

By following this project, you’ll learn to:

* Understand the **boot process** and how BIOS loads an OS
* Write **assembly code** to control hardware directly
* Build a **minimal kernel** in C
* Implement **paging, memory allocation, and interrupts**
* Develop a deep understanding of **how an OS communicates with hardware**

---

## 🌟 Why This Project?

Because the best way to understand how computers *really* work…
is to **build one yourself**.

This repository is for learners, hobbyists, and developers who want to go beyond high-level programming and dive into the heart of computing.

Would you like me to include **installation commands** for setting up the `i686-elf` GCC toolchain and QEMU (for Windows, Linux, and macOS users)?  
That would make your README more beginner-friendly and complete.
